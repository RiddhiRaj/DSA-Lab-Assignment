# Given a stack of boxes in different colors. Write a python function that accepts the stack of boxes and removes those boxes having color other than the primary colors (Red, Green and Blue) from the stack. The removed boxes should be en-queued into a new queue and returned. The original stack should have only the boxes having primary colors and the order must be maintained.Perform case sensitive string comparison wherever necessary.Note: Consider the queue to be of the same size as that of the original stack.


def remove_color(stack):
    new_stack = []
    new_queue = []
    while stack:
        box = stack.pop()
        if box == 'Red' or box == 'Green' or box == 'Blue':
            new_stack.append(box)
            new_queue.append(box)
    return new_stack, new_queue


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input("Enter the number of boxes: "))
    stack = []
    for i in range(a):
        stack.append(input("Enter the color of the box: "))
    print("The stack is: ", stack)
    new_stack, new_queue = remove_color(stack)
    print("The new stack is: ", new_stack)
    print("The new queue is: ", new_queue)
    print("The original stack is: ", stack)
    print("The original queue is: ", stack)

# Enter the number of boxes: 5
# Enter the color of the box: Red
# Enter the color of the box: Yellow
# Enter the color of the box: Blue
# Enter the color of the box: Green
# Enter the color of the box: RedThe stack is:  ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Red']
# The new stack is:  ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Red']
# The new queue is:  ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Red']
